## User Dining Preference Prediction Based on Social Network Reviews

Team project of CSI 535 Data mining.

### Problem and research question definition:

The YELP dataset provides millions of reviews for the restaurant. We are curious about how do users decide to dine in a a certain type of restaurants based on their friend reviews. To put it in another word, given the reviews of one’s friends, we would like to predict the user’s dining preference to a certain type of restaurant. This project can help us discover the latent correlation between the user’s decision and the influence of social network reviews.
